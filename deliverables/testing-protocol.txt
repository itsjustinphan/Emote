For all of our key features, we used manual testing such as utilizing 
Console.log() to check if the outputs match what we are expecting.

**Key Feature #1: Quiz Results Array**
- We tested our quiz results by using Console.log() to check if the 
output matches the actual result of the quiz, and that the bubble sizes
of our chart are proportional to the results of the quiz.
- The expected output should be an accurate bubble chart that shows the
results of the quiz accurately and appropriately.
- There were no workarounds done as there were no bugs.

**Key Feature #2: Ensuring the bubbles route to the correct path**
- We tested our paths by using Console.log() to check if d and 
d.data are defined before accessing the 'name' property. What this means
is that it is ensuring that the bubbles are routed to the correct path.
- The expected result would be if the bubble's data is properly defined 
and contains a name property (emotion), the browser would navigate to a 
new URL path that matches the name property (emotion) of the clicked 
bubble. If d or d.data is not defined, it logs an error to the 
console indicating that the data or its name property is undefined.
- There were no workarounds done as there were no bugs.

**Key Feature #3: Ensuring quiz results are correct before setting the state**
- We tested our quiz results by using Console.log() to check if the quiz
results are correct before setting the state.
- The expected output would be the correct and accurate results from the
quiz, before the state is set.
- There were no workarounds done as there were no bugs.
